<h1>Project Istria</h1>

<div class="block">
	<h2>Description</h2>
	<div class="text-block">
		<p>During the summer 2004 I started to work on the creation of an RPG game named Istria, developer in <a href="https://www.thegamecreators.com/product/dark-basic-pro-open-source" target="_blank">Dark Basic</a>.
		I'm not a designer, nor a musician. I choose to use the assets from <a href="http://www.rpgmakerweb.com/" tager="_blank">RPG Maker</a>.
		I started to create technical demos first to improve my 2D skills with this programming language and to make sure I could actually commit myself to such an important project.
		After a few weeks of practice and tests I felt that I was ready for this challenge.</p>
		<p>With these experimentations I already created a basic display engine.
		I knew the next step was to be able to generate maps quickly so I created a basic map editor for my needs.
		Then I worked on improving my engine to animate the characters, move our hero around the map, handle the map scrolling, add NPCs <i>(Non-player character)</i> and develop the events (map change when reaching specific tiles, interactions with NPCs, saving, etc).
		Once all the basic was coded I worked on the engine for turn-based battles (with up to 3 fighters in each side).</p>
		<p>The engine for the itself was then basically done.
		I needed now to create content and for that I needed a much more advanced editor to create maps faster and save time when placing event markers, populate maps with NPCs and random foes, etc.
		I choose to split the editors: MapMaker for the design, MapCompletor for all other things.
		Both were coded with <a href="https://www.purebasic.com/" target="_blank">PureBasic</a>, a language I recently discovered showing much better performances and with OOP.</p>
		<p>Istria offers about 20 minutes of gameplay.
		The project was stopped in May 2005 as I was unable to allocate enough time anymore to work on it regularly due to homeworks/studies.
		The game engine is fully working, it is then just a matter of dedicating time to add maps, events, etc.
		The challenge was successfully completed and I learned a lot from this experience.</p>
