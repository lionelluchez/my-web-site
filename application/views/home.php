	<div class="text-block">
		<p>I learned programming basics at the age of 15 during an experimental class at school involving computer science, physics and electronics.
		We were connecting a circuit board with sensors to computers using a parallel port.
		The goal was to create the program with <b>Quick Basic 4.5</b> to display values read from the sensors after calibration to the screen.
		My friends and I enjoyed it so much that we were first competing to create the best UI and finally challenged ourselves into creating our own games:
		Tetris, Pong, Snake, labyrinth, etc., with Quick Basic and even games on graphic TI calculators.
		I was also replicating the graphics of Gameboy games without using images but by drawing colored points and lines on the screen.</p>
		<p>It was time to move to a more advanced programming language.
		I bought the game maker called <b>3D Games Creator</b> (Dark Basic) and created my first big game with it called <a href="#/istria">Istria</a>,
		and later on I switched to <b>PureBasic</b> which is an amazing language to create games and tools for Windows and Linux.
		I created many window applications with PB including an MP3 player (<a href="#/programs/alp">Audio Lib Player</a>) I still use.</p>
		<p>In the meantime I also started to learn Web programming in the early 20s, first using only <b>HTML</b>/<b>CSS</b>,
		adding some <b>JavaScript</b> later on.
		That's only at the university that I learned server-side languages to create back-ends.
		<b>PHP</b> was the language I liked the most and I developed a PHP/JS framework for the creation of websites supporting
		URL rewriting, multi-languages, saving visits statistics, dynamically creating CSS/JS files, facilitating database operations,
		browser detection, showing modal popups and tooltips.</p>

		<p>Since that class, programming has been a true passion for me. I knew this is what I wanted to do as a job.
		Obtaining a Master degree helped me to learn what I was missing as a self-learner especially coming with such a strong Basic background:
		OOP, code structuration, development methodologies, unit testing, state machines helped
		to solve complex problems and face large projects even with changing requirements.</p>
		<p>After graduating I worked for <a href="http://www.amadeus.com/" target="_blank">Amadeus</a>
		<i>(retailing the most widely-used airline Internet booking engine)</i> and I'm currently working for
		<a href="http://ateofinance.com/" target="_blank">Ateo Finance</a>
		<i>(providing tailored solutions for brokers, mostly on derivatives markets, with extensive market connectivity)</i>.</p>

	<h2>About this website</h2>
	<div class="text-block">
		<p>I use this website as a platform to share my creations and make them available for download for everyone.
		None of my projects are protected by any license and I usually release the source code (the website is still under construction).
		Any developer can take over the programs I designed and improve them or just use part of their code to integrate it into their own projects.</p>
		<p>I've also created websites for small businesses and most of them are not online anymore.
		I will work on bringing them online again even if they won't be maintained anymore and information they will be displayed will be outdated.
		But this is interesting to see the evolution from the first sites I created what I can do now including
		responsive design, binding JSON data received through Ajax, etc.</p>
